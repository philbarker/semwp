# semwp
Partial proof of concept that WordPress can be used for creating, 
editing and disseminating semantic linked data, in this case using 
the schema.org vocabulary.

The plugin extends the MetaBox plugin to provide custom post types 
for some schema.org classes/types and forms using custom metadata 
fields to add properties for them. The theme is designed to display
the data entered with embedded RDFa.
